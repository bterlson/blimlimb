   here be a very simple
   script which helms a
   handful of irc connections
   to produce the illusion
   of a performing set of
   sentient ircbots.

   the trick to this script
   is that the bots aren't
   fully scripted, so you
   can jump in at moments
   and add improvisational
   dialogue to startling
   effect.


   `` `` `` `` `` '''''' 

   some sample scripts
   are in the `scripts`
   folder.

   a few logged performances
   are in `logs` to give a
   taste.
